        <meta name="" content="">
        <title></title>
    </head>

links are used with anchor tag <a> where you set the attribut href to the link, href="link". You can also use files instead of links. It will redirect to them.
This is useful for the header and especially the navigation to travel between sites.
Useful to include target attribute to target="_blank" and rel to rel="noopener norefferer". So it opens a new and secure window when clicked. 
So people dont loose your site.

images are used with the tag <img/>. You set the src attribute to the image location or link. <img src=""/>. Include alt attribute to display something else 
if the img cant be found or loaded. Good practice to include
You can resize with width and height attribute. Only using one will automatically give a risized aspect ratio. Using both will give a custom res.
